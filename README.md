# Seddon does Holmans's dotfiles

## dotfiles

These dotfiles have been forked from Zach Holman's because I like the modular nature of the hierarchy. They are
particulary geared towards the way I work so so you'll probably want to fork the original. This repository
includes AWS packages, more use of Brewfiles rather than calling brew install and various other small changes. 

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bluespore/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

## thanks

Cheers to [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman) and his awesome [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) repo.
